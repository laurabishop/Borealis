## Usage

These scripts process motion capture and pupillometry data that were captured during an experiment and concert with a string quartet, and during a follow-up listening experiment.

The script Motion.R processes motion capture data from the quartet performances, and should be run before Pupillometry.R, which analyzes pupillometry data from the performances, and Pupillometry-Listeners.R, which analyzes pupillometry data from the listening experiment.
